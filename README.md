# Transaction Monitoring Process: Regulatory Translation & Operational Implementation

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive **Transaction Monitoring (TM) Framework** designed to bridge the gap between high-level regulatory requirements and day-to-day operational execution. 

The core of this project is a practical application of the **Luxembourg Law of 12 November 2004** (as amended) regarding the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. It demonstrates the ability to "translate" a complex legal framework into a robust, professional and actionable operational process.

## Key Contributions & Methodology
This framework is the result of a full-scale **process revamp** aimed at enhancing compliance accuracy while maintaining operational efficiency. The methodology includes:

*   **Regulatory Mapping:** A granular alignment of the 2004 Law’s provisions with specific monitoring triggers and alert typologies.
*   **Operational Revamp:** Beyond theoretical compliance, the process was re-engineered to fit a high-paced professional environment, ensuring that every regulatory "must" is met with a clear "how-to" for analysts.
*   **Conditional Logic Tooling:** To satisfy stringent regulator expectations, I developed a specialized **Conditional Logic Engine (Excel-based)**. This tool automates risk scoring and decision-making paths based on specific transaction parameters, ensuring consistency and auditability that meets the highest supervisory standards.

## Professional Context
This project reflects my experience in taking legacy monitoring systems and transforming them into modern, regulator-approved workflows. By integrating conditional logic and clear data mapping, the resulting process provides a "single source of truth" that satisfies both internal efficiency goals and external regulatory scrutiny.
